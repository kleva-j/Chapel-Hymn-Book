# Chapel-Hymn-Book

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Hono, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **React Native** - Build mobile apps using React
- **Expo** - Tools for React Native development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **workers** - Runtime environment
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
Use the Expo Go app to run the mobile application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment (Cloudflare via Alchemy)

- Dev: cd apps/server && pnpm run dev
- Deploy: cd apps/server && pnpm run deploy
- Destroy: cd apps/server && pnpm run destroy
